Second, per BNPL provider splitit - single biggest challenge is how to  overcome lost ecommerce sales.

We aim for the market for everyday transactions and micropayments powered with Crypto and BNPL.

Platform integrates third party apps, merchants, online ecommerce stores and famous staking mechanism.

Introducing ConCred token that is reward format on defined events – purchase, installment paid.

Concred is bringing two sets of features 
1. Integrated wallets of NEAR, ETHERUM and AURORA and corresponding defi functions like show transactions, wallet transfer, staking to earn a yield and more.
2. Introducing ConCred tokens to integrate BNPL model for cryptocurrency

App displays transactions for each token be it NEAR, Ethereum and Aurora. App as well has features to filter and search on transactions. Transfer allows to move tokens among integrated wallets and with ConCred as well.

ConCred Wallet tab highlights dashboard that indicates available ConCred tokens as balance, Limit and spent. This dashboard drives limits for an individual on limits to BNPL credit for an ecommerce transaction be it online or offline store.

Here in case of BNPL option- repayment can be done through defined EMI. This can be done through available wallet currency or their debit or credit cards.

## How we built it
This is achieved through proven tech stack that gives us needed agility, scale and ease of integration in ecosystem.

Outsystems as a low code platform to bring experience to users through multiple channels – web, mobile android and ios both.

Node.js to get the APIs generated on top of NEAR blockchain, for the consumption be ecommerce platform or ConCred app on various demoed features.

Developed APIs, balance and transfer include underlying NEAR API based on NEAR account ID.

## Challenges we ran into
